about.embedTitle=Info about ModMailBot.
about.embedDesc=ModMailBot is a FOSS ModMail Bot for Discord, created by the HyacinthBots organization. Designed to be easy to use, complete with all the features you find in the bigger bots, but safe from a paywall.
about.howSupportTitle=How can I support the continued development of ModMailBot
about.howSupportValue=ModMailBot is developed primarily by NoComment#6411 in their free time. Hyacinth doesn't have the resources to invest in dedicated hosting, so financial donations via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/Hyacinthbots) help keep Lily afloat. Currently, we run lily on a Hetzner cloud server, which we can afford in our current situation. We also have domain costs for our website.\n\nContributions of code & documentation are also incredibly appreciated!
